The company provides solar systems, installation, and financing services.", "Products\/Technology": "Astrum Solar offers turnkey solar PV system development and installation for the residential rooftop market. Astrum Solar's solar panels use efficient crystalline silicon technology and microinverters.The company offers solar lease financing through its minority parent company, Constellation Energy, including pay-as-you-go financing with little or no upfront payment for residential customers. Additionally, the company provides post-installation ongoing services including monitoring and maintenance, power production guarantees, and aggregation and certification of solar renewable energy credits (SRECs) awarded by states per megawatt-hour (MWh) generated by the system. The company may employ its own installation staff or contract out for installation and interconnection.", "Strategy": "Astrum Solar's strategy has hinged mostly on stimulative state-level policies designed to speed adoption of solar PV in the residential market. To this end, Astrum Solar markets and provides its SREC aggregation and purchase service to make realization of profit from these credits as easy as possible for the homeowner. Additionally, the company's partnership with its minority parent, Constellation Energy, has allowed the company to offer solar lease options to residential customers.

Applications include robust inks and coatings for the printed electronics market. In energy applications, Vor-x delivers performance gains by enhancing battery capacity and power output. According to the Company, plastic and rubber composites with low Vor-x loadings attain high levels of strength, dimensional stability, conductivity, and environmental resistance.", "Products\/Technology": "Vorbeck Materials converts graphite into Vor-x functionalized graphene, which has strong, thin, and highly conductive characteristics. Since the graphene layers are wrinkled and disassociated, the single sheets do not combine back into a graphite structure, resulting in good dispersion and ease of handling; allowing Vorbeck to maximize the advantages of graphene’s characteristics. Vorbeck focuses on electronics, plastics and rubber, and energy, all of which cater to various industries. The company developed Vor-Ink, which is a graphene-based conductive ink that creates films that are flexible and simultaneously crease resistant. It is responsible for gravure (Vor-Ink Gravure), screen (Vor-Ink Screen), and flexographic (Vor-Ink Flexo) printing applications which all use standard drying equipment. When small amounts of Vor-x functionalized graphene are added to plastic or rubber, the material’s stiffness, thermal stability, and chemical and environmental resistance increases.", "Strategy": "Vorbeck Materials plans to commercialize the next generation of lithium ion batteries that incorporates Vorbeck’s Vor-x graphene technology, and has thus partnered with Pacific Northwest Nationals Laboratory (PNNL) and Princeton University. The company’s batteries have an increased capacity, longer cycle life, and around twice as much power at high charge and discharge rates. These improvements can lead to greater performance of batteries of transportation as well as consumer electronics. Vorbeck has also partnered with Targray Technology International to distribute Vor-Charge anode materials, and Hardwire LLC of Maryland to use the new batteries in hybrid military vehicles. In terms of electronics, Vorbeck’s Vor-Ink caters to customers to develop formulations to suit specific printing methods, substrates, and applications. As of now, products using Vorbeck’s graphene-based circuits are already in being sold in major retail chains.", "Total paid in Capital ($)": 17885000, "Seeking Funding": "No", "Seeking Funding Amount ($)": 0, "Seeking Funding Date": null, "Revenue Range": "$2m - $5m", "Revenue Range Source": "Cleantech Group Estimate", "Date Submitted": 41120, "Has patent": "Not sure of patent", "String: primary cat, tag, short description": "other cleantechenergy & power,other cleantechExporter of Scandinavian, green bulding, renewable energy, transportation and energy efficency technology to the US", "parking": 0, "transportation software": 0, "congestion": 0, "Total": 0, "type": null, "blockchain": null, "consolidated.sector": "other", "number of investments": -2146826273, "Row Labels": null, "Sum of fraction.inventors": null, "#": null, "patent_number": null, "inventor_state": null, "inventor_country": null, "inventor_latitude": null, "inventor_longitude": null, "inventor_county": null, "inventor_city": null, "inventor_key_id": null, "assignee_organization": null, "assignee_state": null, "State_1": null, "assignee_country": null, "assignee_latitude": null, "assignee_longitude": null, "assignee_county": null, "assignee_city": null, "assignee_key_id": null, "app_date": null, "app_id": null, "patent_year": null, "type_1": null, "application_year": null, "tempstring": null, "count.assignees": null, "count.inventors": null, "fraction.inventors": null, "Similarity between patent rematch": null, "Similarity between i3 and [atent": 0.0, "check": null, "Company - start of PRIME data": null, "Founded Year": null, "Location": null, "state_2": null, "Primary Sector_1": null, "Short Description_1": null, "Paid In Capital": null, "Sources of Capital": null, "i3 URL": null, "Company Website": null, "Other Link": null, "Company Stage": null, "Subsector": null, "Breakthrough Technology": null, "Data Source_1": null, "Last Review": null, "Funding Source - start SBIR data": null, "Company Name SBIR": null, "Amount": null, "Similarity in names, i3 to SBIR": 0.0, "biofuels -- funding": null, "CCS -- funding": null, "combustion -- funding": null, "energyeff -- funding": null, "geothermal -- funding": null, "hydromarine -- funding": null, "smartgrid -- funding": null, "solar -- funding": null, "storage -- funding": null, "transport -- funding": null, "wind -- funding": null, "total funding": 0.0, "has funding": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 17.94345665, 59.40148926 ] } },

The company is currently involved in two product areas: harvesting kinetic energy from vehicles and building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).", "Products\/Technology": "New Energy Technologies is currently in development stages with two very different products:The company's MotionPower™ products are designed to capture the kinetic energy available in vehicles which are slowing down before stopping.  The technology, which is essentially a large block replacement for a section of road, harvests the kinetic energy of decelerating vehicles through (depending on the application) either peristaltic pumps or trundle wheels, and converts that energy into electricity for surrounding buildings.  One potential application given by the company is highway toll plazas, where the vehicles rolling through the plaza could supply the electricity for the toll booths and workers, and potentially excess electricity to be fed onto the local distribution grid.  The company's SolarWindow product consists of a transparent, spray-on organic photovoltaic (OPV) coating applied to window panes for the conversion of solar energy into electricity.  The company has not disclosed specific polymers used, but points out that its technology can be produced at ambient room temperature and pressure, which would represent a significant improvement through energy and cost savings over the production of most existing thin-film coatings. In June 2013, the company announced that researchers have achieved important device design, architecture, and transparency goals which now allow it to advance and expand development efforts of its electricity-generating coatings. These expanded research efforts are directed at a specific layer of the coatings, composed largely of polymers, which can be applied to flexible plastics and glass to create tinted, see-through windows able to generate electricity.", "Strategy": "New Energy Technologies is a research and development company targeting disruptive energy technologies in concept phases that it can bring to commercialization.  The company has partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy, the University of South Florida, and outside engineering firms for technology development.
